	 * The Sponge API is just absolutely horrible.
	 * 
	 * So much of its access is disgustingly static. There are no server instances for use.
	 * Worse, the extreme over-use of annotations for basic functionality is just appalling.
	 * As a result of the explosion of annotations, there are no plugin instances, either.
	 * Further, you cannot use simple maven resources filtering in a plugin.yml, because Sponge doesn't use a plugin.yml.
