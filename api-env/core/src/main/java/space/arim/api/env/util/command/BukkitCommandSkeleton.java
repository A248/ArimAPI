/**
 * Command skeleton for Bukkit to be registered directly in the server's command map. <br>
 * <br>
 * The methods intended to be implemented by subclasses are {@link #execute(CommandSender, String[])} for execution
 * and {@link #suggest(CommandSender, String[])} for tab completion. <br>
 * <br>
 * <b>Mutability</b> <br>
 * Bukkit's {@code Command} is primarily designed to be mutable. However, certain steps can be taken to work around this. <br>
 * <br>
 * Firstly, in this subclass, the description, permission, permission message, and usage message are prevented from being changed
 * from the default, which is a blank description, no permission, no permission message, and the name of the command. It is
 * intended that all such handling is conducted by the {@link #execute(CommandSender, String[])} method. <br>
 * <br>
 * Secondly, Bukkit it does not allow changing many details of the command once it has been registered. To reduce mutability
 * to the fullest extent while complying with method contracts, the user may register this command in a command map via
 * {@code CommandMap#register(String, String, Command)} or another appropriate {@code CommandMap} method to have the server
 * recognise the command. Ideally this is done following complete construction.
