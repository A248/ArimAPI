/**
 * Enables compatibility with the Kyori Adventure API. <br>
 * <br>
 * The Adventure API is used on Velocity and thus may be used to send chat messages directly there. Additionally,
 * it has its own platform adapters used to send messages on other platforms. Adventure API classes are immutable,
 * making it well-suitable for a variety of contexts. Its textual API is similar to the Sponge Text API. As an arguable
 * improvement, Adventure uses annotation based null analysis rather than {@code Optional}s. <br>
 * <br>
 * <b>Comparison with ArimAPI</b> <br>
 * <br>
 * <i>Colourful messages</i> <br>
 * With regards to chat colours and style formatting, Adventure defines styles (a.k.a. "decorations") as tristates.
 * ArimAPI only permits enabled and disabled styles. Unset Adventure decorations are converted to disabled styles.
 * The Adventure API fully supports hex colours; conversion of respective colour representations is simple and well defined. <br>
 * <br>
 * <i>Json Messages</i> <br>
 * ArimAPI enables tooltips, urls, commands, suggestions, and insertions. Adventure components have equivalent support
 * for each of these. However, some features from the Adventure API are not available in ArimAPI. <br>
 * <br>
 * For hover actions, ArimAPI only supports displaying tooltip messages. Therefore, only {@code HoverEvent.Action#SHOW_TEXT}
 * is supported. Other actions are ignored during conversion. <br>
 * <br>
 * For click actions, ArimAPI only supports urls, commands, and suggestions. There are no equivalents for the others,
 * which are dropped. <br>
 * <br>
 * <i>Nontext Messages</i> <br>
 * ArimAPI only supports components which are text based. Hence, this class converts {@link TextComponent} and not
 * {@link Component}. <br>
 * <br>
 * <i>Conversion Policy</i> <br>
 * When there are no equivalents for an Adventure API feature, it is simply discarded from the final result.
