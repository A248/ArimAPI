 * tasks, implementations of this interface should use the async variant. <br>
 * <br>
 * Additionally, some implementations may not support accuracy in any arbitrary {@code TimeUnit} due to
 * limitations in the underlying scheduler. In these cases, durations are floored as necessary to estimate
 * the equivalent platform-specific unit. <br>
 * <br>
 * Moreover, not all platform-specific schedulers support {@link ScheduledTask#isCancelled()} natively
 * via their own "task" objects. In these cases, the wrapper implementing {@code ScheduledTask}, which
 * delegates to the platform-specific task object, will maintain its own thread safe tracker for whether
 * the task has been cancelled.
