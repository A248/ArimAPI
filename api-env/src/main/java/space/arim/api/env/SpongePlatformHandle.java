/**
 * Implementation of {@link PlatformHandle} specifically for Sponge servers
 * 
 * @author A248
 *
 * @deprecated Unfortunately, the Sponge platform relies on internals changed by
 *             JPMS in JDK 9 and beyond and is therefore incompatible with Java
 *             11, which ArimAPI requires. It is highly unlikely an
 *             implementation of Sponge API 7 will have compatibility. The
 *             maintenance burden of platform handles and adapters for Sponge
 *             API 7 is therefore not justified.
