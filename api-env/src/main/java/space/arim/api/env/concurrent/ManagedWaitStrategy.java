/**
 * Strategy for {@link FactoryOfTheFuture} implementations which utilize a managed
 * wait. <br>
 * <br>
 * <b>Implementation</b> <br>
 * The {@code await}, {@code awaitInterruptibly}, and {@code awaitUntil} methods implement
 * the managed wait itself. The core objective of these methods is to wait for the completion
 * of a given future, without stalling absolutely. That is, implementations ought to be able
 * to run queued tasks while simultaneously awaiting the completion of the future. This is
 * somewhat similar to the idea of work-stealing. <br
 * <br>
 * Implementations are primarily based on some kind of spin loop. It is not necessary to check
 * whether the future is already complete before entering a spin loop. That is, implementations
 * may wait, check for completion, and keep waiting. <br>
 * <br>
 * Each method is provided with a {@code Runnable} which is to be used to run outstanding
 * queued tasks. The runnable may be invoked multiple times, and each time it will run and
 * clear the task queue. <br>
 * <br>
 * It would be folly for implementations to call any of the {@code join} or {@code get} methods
 * on the provided future, as it is these methods which themselves rely on the managed wait
 * strategy.
