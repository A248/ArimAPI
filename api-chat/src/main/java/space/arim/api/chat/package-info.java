/**
 * A chat API designed to represent sections of chat messages

 * <br>
 * @deprecated The Adventure API has grown to the point where it
 * would be futile to pursue alternative APIs, merely based on
 * the popularity of the former. Although this API provides
 * a somewhat better abstraction over messages using the Json.sk
 * format or formatting codes, Adventure is far more comprehensive,
 * and a better Json.sk parser ought to be built on top of it. As such,
 * {@link space.arim.api.jsonchat} has been created as a replacement.
