/**
 * A service designed for multithreading via asynchronous concurrent execution and scheduling. <br>
 * <b>Effectively a clone of {@link AsyncExecution} but with modified contract specifications.</b> <br>
 * <br>
 * <b>Specifications:</b> <br>
 * * from {@link Registrable}: requires {@link #getPriority()} <br>
 * * from {@link EnhancedExecutor}: requires {@link #execute(Runnable)} <br>
 * * from {@link Scheduler}: requires {@link #runTaskLater(Runnable, long)} and {@link #runTaskTimerLater(Runnable, long, long)} <br>
 * <br>
 * <b>Contract:</b> <br>
 * * from Registrable: Implementations should be registered under SyncExecution. <br>
 * * from Scheduler: {@link Task#cancel()} method implementations should properly cancel further scheduling. Also, time units are in <i>milliseconds</i>.<br>
 * * SyncExecution: <b>All execution and scheduled tasks MUST run on the main thread</b> if the application has a main thread. <br>
 * <br>
 * SyncExecution differs from {@link ExecutorService} in a few important ways. First, it is a Registrable.
 * Second, SyncExecution is not necessarily a thread pool, but simply an executor and scheduler.
 * Thus it does not specify any methods relating to shutting down, awaiting termination, or invoking other callers' submissions.
 * Thirdly, SyncExecution enables scheduling, which simple thread pools do not.
