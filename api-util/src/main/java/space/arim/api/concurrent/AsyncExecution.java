/**
 * A service designed for multithreading via asynchronous concurrent execution and scheduling. <br>

 * <b>Contract and specifications:</b> see {@link #execute(Runnable)} <br>
 * <br>
 * AsyncExecution differs from {@link java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService ExecutorService}
 * in a few important ways.
 * First, AsyncExecution is not necessarily a thread pool, but simply an executor and scheduler.
 * Thus it does not specify any methods relating to shutting down, awaiting termination, or invoking other callers' submissions.
 * Second, AsyncExecution enables scheduling, which simple thread pools do not.
 * Third, AsyncExecution is designed to be implemented registered as a service in a
 * {@link space.arim.universal.registry.Registry Registry}.
