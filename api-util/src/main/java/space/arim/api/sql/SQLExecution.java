/**
 * A kind of plugin or application which is able to execute queries. <br>
 * <br>
 * All methods throw {@link SQLException}
 * 
 * @author A248
 * 
 * @deprecated For multiple reasons. First, the void return types of {@link #executionQuery(String, Object...)}
 * and {@link #executionQueries(ExecutableQuery...)} make it unclear whether implementations may execute queries
 * in a separate thread. Additionally, they do not allow for retrieving update counts. Second, the array-based
 * return type of {@link #selectionQueries(ExecutableQuery...)} is cumbersome for working with try-with-resources
 * and requires that each result set be closed. See the package javadoc for an alternative.
