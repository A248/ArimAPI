/**
 * Subclass of {@link LoggingSql} using HikariCP for the implementation.
 * 
 * @author A248
 *
 * @deprecated For multiple reasons. First, see deprecation of {@link SQLExecution}, {@link AbstractSql}, and {@link LoggingSql}.
 * This class, specifically, presupposes a long{@literal -}running <code>Connection</code> which is reused for SQL queries.
 * Such a practice should not be encouraged, for it leads itself to perpetual timeout issues; using properties such as
 * <i>autoReconnect</i> only complicates matters and causes more issues. Furthermore, concurrent use of this class requires
 * external synchronisation because a <code>Connection</code> is not always safe. On a minor note, this class also creates
 * unnecessary wrapper objects for <code>Connection</code> to avoid closing the long running connection due to the design
 * of {@link space.arim.api.sql}.
