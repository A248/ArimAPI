	 * @param julLogger the JUL logger
	 * @return a slf4j logger

	 * a global logger instance for a plugin which must be used at all times, thus necessitating
	 * a converter logger for different logging APIs which this method provides, programmers
	 * should simply derive loggers directly from the logging factory from the framework desired.
