/**
 * A dynamic entry set based on a backing map. <br>
 * Relies on {@link Map#keySet()} and {@link Map#get(Object)} to dynamically generate the collection. <br>
 * <br>
 * Specifications: <br>
 * * The set automatically reflects the state of the backing map. Keys are fetched on call. <br>
 * * The set is an unmodifiable view. Writes are not permitted. <br>
 * * The iterator returned by {@link #iterator()} is immutable. <br>
 * * The entries returned by the iterator are immutable. <br>
 * <br>
 * Notes: <br>
 * * {@link #size()} and {@link #isEmpty()} redirect to the backing map. <br>
 * * {@link #containsAll(Collection)} does not rely on {@link #contains(Object)}. Both rely on {@link #iterator()}. One or the other may be overriden.
