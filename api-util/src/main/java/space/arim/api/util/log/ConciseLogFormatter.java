 * A simple implementation of <code>java.util.logging.Formatter</code> based on BungeeCord's <code>ConciseFormatter</code>.

 * this class contained a thread safety issue with {@code SimpleDateFormat} (as does currently BungeeCord's);
 * to solve this, potentially inefficient synchronisation is used.
