/**
 * A service designed for multithreading via asynchronous concurrent execution. <br>
 * <br>
 * * AsyncExecutor is a {@link Registrable}, which specifies {@link #getPriority()} <br>
 * * AsyncExecutor is an {@link BasicExecutor}, which specifies {@link #execute(Runnable)} <br>
 * <br>
 * AsyncExecutor differs from {@link ExecutorService} in a few important ways. First, it is a Registrable.
 * Second, AsyncExecutor is stripped to mere execution; it is not necessarily a thread pool.
 * AsyncExecutor does not specify any of ExecutorService's methods relating to
 * shutting down, termination, or invoking other callers' submissionse.
 * In fact, the only required method related to execution of tasks is {@link #execute(Runnable)}.
