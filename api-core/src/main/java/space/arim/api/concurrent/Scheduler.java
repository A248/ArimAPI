/**
 * A scheduler designed for creating delayed tasks.
 * <br>
 * Requirements:
 * {@link #runTaskLater(Runnable, long)}
 * {@link #runTaskTimerLater(Runnable, long, long)}
 * <br>
 * Each method specified by Scheduler itself returns a {@link Task} to provide basic cancellation. <br>
 * <br>
 * All time units are in <b>MILLISECONDS</b> to provide compatibility with implementing platforms which do not support other units.
 * <br>
 * All methods accept either a basic {@link Runnable} or a {@link Consumer} as the task to schedule. <br>
 * The consumer may be used so that the executing task can cancel its own scheduling. <br>
 * <br>
 * {@link #runTaskLater(Runnable, long)} and {@link #runTaskTimerLater(Runnable, long, long)}
 * are required, while {@link #runTask(Runnable)} and {@link #runTaskTimer(Runnable, long)} have default implementations
 * which call the required methods, but may be overriden where the underlying Scheduler implementation supports it.
 * The methods accepting Consumer instead of Runnable parameters need never be overriden.
